Name:
Frequency analysis

Statement:
<p>Given a number \( n \), followed by \( n \) lines of text,
print all words encountered in the text, one per line.
The words should be sorted in descending order according to their number of occurrences in the text,
and all words with the same frequency should be printed in lexicographical order.</p>

<p><b>Hint.</b> After you create a dictionary of the words and their frequencies,
you would like to sort it according to the frequencies. This can be achieved if you create a list
whose elements are tuples of two elements: the frequency of occurrence of a word
and the word itself. For example, <code>[(2, 'hi'), (1, 'what'), (3, 'is')]</code>.
Then the standard list sort will sort a list of tuples, with
the tuples compared by the first element, and if these are equal,
by the second element. This is <b>nearly</b> what is required in the problem.</p>

That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,
Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,
Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
