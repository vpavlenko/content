{% section "While loop" %}
<p><code>while</code> loop repeats
the sequence of actions many times until some condition evaluates to <code>False</code>.
The condition is given before the loop body and is checked before each execution of the loop body.
Typically, the <code>while</code> loop is used when it is impossible
to determine the exact number of loop iterations in advance.

<p>The syntax of the <code>while</code> loop in the simplest case looks like this:

{% noprogram %}
while some condition:
    a block of statements
{% endnoprogram %}

<p>Python firstly checks the condition.
If it is False, then the loop is terminated and control
is passed to the next statement after the <code>while</code> loop body.
If the condition is True, then the loop body is executed, and then the condition
is checked again.
This continues while the condition is True.
Once the condition becomes False, the loop terminates and
control is passed to the next statement after the loop.

<p>For example, the following program fragment prints
the squares of all integers from 1 to 10. Here one can replace the "while" loop by the 
<code>for ... in range(...)</code> loop:

{% program %} 
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i ** 2)
    i += 1
{% endprogram %}
 
<p>In this example, the variable <code>i</code> inside the loop iterates from 1 to 10.
Such a variable whose value changes with each new loop iteration
is called a counter. Note that after executing this fragment
the value of the variable <code>i</code> is defined and is equal to <code>11</code>,
because when <code>i == 11</code> the condition <code>i &lt;= 10</code> is False for the first time.


<p>Here is another example use of the <code>while</code> loop
to determine the number of digits of an integer <code>n</code>:

{% program %}
n = int(input())
length = 0
while n > 0:
    n //= 10  # this is equivalent to n = n // 10
    length += 1
print(length)  # 4
{% inputdata %}
5678
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

<p>On each iteration we cut the last digit of the number
using integer division by 10 (<code>n //= 10</code>). In the variable 
<code>length</code> we count how many times we did that.

<p>In Python there is another, easier way to solve this problem:
<code><nobr>length = len(str(i))</nobr></code>.

{% section "Loop control flow" %}

{% section "else" %}

<p>One can write an <code>else:</code> statement after a loop body which is executed
<i>once</i> after the end of the loop:

{% program %}
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print('Loop ended, i =', i)
{% endprogram %}

<p>At the first glance, this statement doesn't seem to have sense, because the <code>else:</code> statement
body can just be put <i>after</i> the end of the loop. "else" statement after a loop only has sense when used
in combination with the instruction <code>break</code>. If during the execution of the loop Python interpreter encounters
<code>break</code>, it immediately stops the loop execution and exits out of it.
In this case, the <code>else:</code> branch is not executed. So, <code>break</code> is used to abort the loop execution during
the middle of any iteration.

<p>Here is a Black Jack-like example: a program that reads numbers and sums it
until the total gets greater or equal to 21. The input sequence ends with 0
for the program to be able to stop even if the total sum of all numbers is less than 21.

<p>Let's see how it behaves on the different inputs.

<p><b>Version 1.</b> The loop is exited normally after checking the condition, so the "else"
branch is executed.
{% program %}
total_sum = 0
a = int(input())
while a != 0:
    total_sum += a
    if total_sum >= 21:
        print('Total sum is', total_sum)
        break
    a = int(input())
else:
    print('Total sum is less than 21 and is equal to', total_sum, '.')
{% inputdata %}
2
4
7
0
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

<p><b>Version 2.</b> The loop is aborted by <code>break</code>, so the "else"
branch is skipped.
{% program %}
total_sum = 0
a = int(input())
while a != 0:
    total_sum += a
    if total_sum >= 21:
        print('Total sum is', total_sum)
        break
    a = int(input())
else:
    print('Total sum is less than 21 and is equal to', total_sum, '.')
{% inputdata %}
9
9
5
4
0
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

<p>"Else" branch can also be used with the "for" loop. Let's look at the example when a program reads 5 integers
but stops right when the first negative integer is met.

<p><b>Version 1.</b> The loop is exited normally, so the "else" branch is executed.
{% program %}
for i in range(5):
    a = int(input())
    if a < 0:
        print('Met a negative number', a)
        break
else:
    print('No negative numbers met')

{% inputdata %}
3
6
2
4
5
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

<p><b>Version 2.</b> The loop is aborted, so the "else" branch isn't executed.
{% program %}
for i in range(5):
    a = int(input())
    if a < 0:
        print('Met a negative number', a)
        break
else:
    print('No negative numbers met')

{% inputdata %}
3
6
-2
4
5
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

{% endsection %}


{% section "continue" %}

<p>Another instruction used to control the loop execution is
<code>continue</code>. If Python interpreter meets <code>continue</code> somewhere in the middle of the loop iteration,
it skips all the remaining instructions and proceeds to the next iteration.

{% program %}
for num in range(2, 10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Found an even number", num)
        continue
    print("Found a number", num)
{% endprogram %}

<p>If the <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> are placed inside several nested
loops, they affect only the execution of the innermost one. Let's look at rather silly example
to demonstrate it:

{% program %}
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(5):
        if j > i:
            # breaks only the for on line 2
            break
        print(i, j)
{% endprogram %}

<p>The instructions <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> 
are discouraged, if you can implement your idea without using them.
Here is a typical example of a <i>bad usage</i> of the <code>break</code>:
this code counts the number of digits in an integer.

{% program %}
n = int(input())
length = 0
while True:
    length += 1
    n //= 10
    if n == 0:
        break
print('Length is', length)
{% inputdata %}
567
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

<p>It's cleaner and easier-to-read to rewrite this loop with a meaningful loop condition:
{% program %}
n = int(input())
length = 0
while n != 0:
    length += 1
    n //= 10
print('Length is', length)
{% inputdata %}
567
{% endinputdata %}
{% endprogram %}

{% endsection %}

{% endsection %}


{% section "Multiple assignment" %}
<p>In Python it is possible for a single assignment statement to change the value of several variables. Let's see:

{% program %}
a, b = 0, 1
{% endprogram %}

<p>The effect demonstrated above code can be written as:
{% program %}
a = 0
b = 1
{% endprogram %}

<p>The difference between the two versions is that multiple assignment changes the values of two variables simultaneously.

<p>Multiple assignment is useful when you need to exchange the values of two variables. In older programming languages
 without the support of multiple assignment this can be done using the auxiliary variable:
{% program %}
a = 1
b = 2
tmp = a
a = b
b = tmp
print(a, b)
# 2 1
{% endprogram %}

<p>In Python, the same swap can be written in one line:
{% program %}
a = 1
b = 2
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)
# 2 1
{% endprogram %}

<p>The left-hand side of "=" should have a comma-separated list of variable names.
The right-hand side can be any expressions,
separated by commas. The left-hand side and the right-hand side lists should be of equal length.
